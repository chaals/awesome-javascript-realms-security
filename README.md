> Curated list of Javascript Realms Security resources

Due to the rise of dependencies based development, the javascript ecosystem (and the browser javascript ecosystem in particular) is far more vulnerable to what we know as ‚Äúsupply chain attacks‚Äù - and the ability to create new realms in javascript is being leveraged to successfully carry out such attacks against web apps.

It's time to research and learn more about javascript realms and offensive/defensive security around them.
